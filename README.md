### Hi! 👋

I'm Shawn Tabai, and I'm a software engineer. I love solving problems and enjoy working on scalable infrastructure. I also love to laugh at the absurdity of the world.

I'm a parent, a promoter of mental health, an opponent of the patriarchy, and an advocate for social equity. I believe the field of computer science desperately needs to increase its outreach to underrepresented groups, and I want to contribute to that in any way I can.

I'm a genderqueer male, and happily accept any pronouns. 🙂

The last thing I made is a guide for [How to Program Time](http://stab.ai/time)

In addition to programming, I'm a big fan of:
* 🐉 D&D
* 🤯 Philosophy
* 👾 Retro games
* 🧗‍ Rock climbing
* 📕 Lord of the Rings
* 👍 Mentoring
* 🎤 Karaoke

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawntabai/) or [Odyssey](https://community.join-odyssey.com/c/profile?user=8258d2fc).
